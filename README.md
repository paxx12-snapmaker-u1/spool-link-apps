# SpoolLink

> This is just unstable proof of concept. Use this just as an example.

SpoolLink is a companion app for [Spoolman](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman) that links existing NFC
tags to filament spools for use with Snapmaker U1. It does not create custom NFC tags; it records and
manages tag UIDs in Spoolman so a tag is assigned to only one spool at a time. For writing tags, use
other applications from the relevant app marketplaces.

## How it works

1. Scan any NFC tag — blank tags and OpenSpool-format tags are both supported.
2. Assign the tag to an existing Spoolman spool, or create a new one. If the tag carries
   OpenSpool data, the filament fields are pre-filled automatically.
3. The card's UID is linked to the spool in Spoolman, and removed from any other spool it was
   previously linked to. Links are stored in the `card_uids` custom field by default, or as Spoolman
   native tags (v0.27.0 or newer) when selected under **Settings → Tag Storage**. Use the same
   setting as **Spoolman Tag Storage** on the printer, which reads only that store. Existing links
   can be moved between the two from the same settings section.

A tag can be reassigned or unlinked at any time by scanning it again. Spools work best
with two tags — one on each side — so the spool is detected regardless of orientation.

## Apps

| Platform | Location | Language | Guide |
|----------|----------|----------|-------|
| Android | `android-app/` | Kotlin / Jetpack Compose | [User Guide](docs/ANDROID.md) |
| iOS | `ios-app/` | Swift / SwiftUI | [User Guide](docs/IOS.md) |
| Web | `web-app/` | Plain HTML + JS | |

All three apps connect to the same Spoolman server over HTTP. Configure the server URL in Settings.
Only the Android and iOS apps are properly tested; the web app is currently not fully tested.

## Compatibility

| Feature | Android | iOS | Web |
|---------|---------|-----|-----|
| NTAG NFC tags | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Mifare NFC tags | Yes | No | No |
| Scan tag | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Read OpenSpool format | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Create and assign spool | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Spoolman native tags | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Requires HTTPS + CORS | No | No | Yes |
| Requires paid developer certificate | No | Yes (NFC entitlement) | No |

## Running

**Android** — requires a connected device with USB debugging enabled and Android SDK installed:

```bash
./android-app/run.sh
```

**iOS** — open `ios-app/NFCSpoolReader.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run on a physical device.
Requires a paid Apple Developer subscription — NFC entitlements are not available with a free
account.

**Web** — open `web-app/index.html` directly, or serve it with any static file server.
Requires Spoolman to be accessible over HTTPS and have CORS configured to allow the page's origin.
